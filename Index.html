        comment: "According to your statement, this fault is suspicious because it has happened three times in a row, and the same issue occurred all three times. I have a few questions: 1. Has the pump inlet size decreased? In this type of pump, the pipe should be 1/2 or 1 size. 2. Have you used this pump in other projects with similar issues? 3. Did you install the inverter panel? Did the inverter setup work properly, and does the pump operate without any noise? 4. Is the motor temperature fine? I believe the fault lies in the project itself because if the same issue occurred three times, the pump is not the problem.",
